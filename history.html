                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>The great man Sankardev started the culture of Assamese drama in Assam with his drama
                    “Chinhayatra”. The addition of Gunaviram Baruah’s “Ramnavami” in the middle part of 1982
                    century, the drama movement got a momentum in Assam. In this way people continued the
                    development of drama movement in Assam since then. With a view to develop this movement the
                    drama organization ‘Sadou Asom Akanka Nat Sanmilan’ got birth in Dibrugrah town under the
                    presidentship of Kalaguru Bishnu Prasad Rabha and the Sanmilon continued its activities in the
                    field of drama. After a few years in the convention held in Mangaldoi in 1967, the constitution
                    was amended and the organisation was renamed as “Asom Natya Sanmilan.” Since then the
                    organisation took step to open its branches in the different parts of Assam. Many big and
